# We're going to build a tip calculator.
# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
# Each person should pay:
# (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
# After formatting the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

tip_as_percent = tip / 100
total_bill = bill + (bill * tip_as_percent)
pay_per_friend = (total_bill / people)
rounded_pay_per_friend = round(pay_per_friend, 2)
print(f"Each person should pay ${rounded_pay_per_friend}.")
