student_scores = [150, 142, 185, 120, 171, 184, 149, 24, 59, 68, 199, 78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# COMPLETE THIS CHALLENGE WITHOUT USING max()
# You are given a list of exam scores, and you have to print out the highest score
# from the List. You will need to use what you have learnt about Lists,
# For Loops and Conditionals to print out the highest score in the list of student_scores.
# For example, if the scores were:

highest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
    if score > highest_score:
        highest_score = score

print(highest_score)
